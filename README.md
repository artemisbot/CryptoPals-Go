# CryptoPals Challenges - Go Edition
I've been meaning to complete [CryptoPals](https://cryptopals.com/) for years - I've recently found solace in [GoLang](https://golang.org/), so I'm teaching it to myself through the powers of cryptography.

As such, the syntax, use of functions and a million other things will not be up to what might come out of an experienced Go programmer, but this is just a learning experience for me :D

## Usage
Choose a set number `n`:
```sh
$ cd set{n}
$ go test -v
```
This will run through each of the challenges for that set, verifying the expected output to what my software generates.
